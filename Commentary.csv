" The umpires stroll out. Mumbai take a different approach, absolutely stomping the lawn as they run out. Gambhir's taking guard, and Malinga is measuring his run-up. No slips.  ",7.58pm
" Two of the four batsmen Harbhajan has dismissed most often in the IPL (four times) are Gautam Gambhir and Manish Pandey. The other two are Suresh Raina and Dwayne Smith. Both Pandey (6.00) and Gambhir (6.46) score at less than seven an over against Harbhajan.  An extension of that last stat: we might see an over from Malinga, an over from McCleneghan and then spin against Lynn in the Powerplay. Run-rate 4.90 against left-arm spin and 3.33 against right-arm spin in the Powerplays. He's been dismissed thrice by left-arm spinners in the PP.  ",7.55pm
" Ten minutes from start and here's something to chew on: Chris Lynn can be destructive against right-arm pace - he has scored at a run rate of 10.93 against them - but hasn't been as good against other kinds of bowling - left-arm pace (7.93), left-arm spin (6.16) and right-arm spin (7.05).   ",7.50pm
" Since the start of the 2015 season, the last-five-overs run rate at the Wankhede is 11.59, the second-most of all IPL venues behind Brabourne Stadium (12.16).  Timothy: &quot;I think it's absolutely rubbish that they don't play Shakib Al Hasan. Since Sunil Narine's change in bowling action, he's looked less threatening. He should've been replaced by Shakib.&quot; ---- Shakib's also earned a rest, though - series in NZ, India and Sri Lanka leading up to the IPL.  </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""3"">",7.47pm

That's the most Rohit has against any bowler in the IPL.  </P></page>

" Not too far from the toss now. In eight of 12 games at this venue in the last two years, teams batting first have posted above 170. However, teams batting first lost all four games at the Wankhede in IPL 2016.   </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""3"">Some nice numbers if you're a Kolkata fan: At this venue in 2016, spinners took 16 wickets at 20.12, economy of 7.00, as opposed to pacers who took 26 wickets at 34.30, economy of 8.52   Zabin: &quot;how likely is Shakib to play?&quot; --- He's with the team, but they might not be willing to change a winning combination.  Mustafa Moudi: &quot;Both these sides scored exactly 184 in the last match. The only difference is KKR was way too brutal by scoring it in just 14.5 overs without losing a wicket&quot;  </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""4"">And more from Vishal: 'The stands are pretty packed already. Lights are flashing, the music is blaring, people are sweating…a usual IPL day at Wankhede'  ",7.28pm
" Our man Vishal Dikshit reports from Mumbai: 'The two teams are warming up. Malinga, Harbhajan, Bumrah and McClenaghan bowling next to the pitch. That means Southee will probably have to sit out. It's the Wankhede so, obviously, SRT getting all the attention. He's right next to the pitch. First L Balaji has a chat with him, then KP walks up to him and now Jacques Kallis has joined him.'  </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""5"">SKA: &quot;Saurabh for Rayadu, Malinga for Southee, and Bhaji for Krunal Pandya. Though i am tempted to give Krunal a game, unless the team think tank is looking at Karn Sharma. Jos should open with Parthiv&quot;  Rahul: &quot;@Vivek Replace the injured Rayadu with Bhajji and you have the most balanced team of the IPL. Also Malinga replaces Southee &quot;  </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""6"">Rishav: &quot;IPL should seriously have away team captain decide whether to bat or bowl instead if toss. With home and away games it will even things out at the end. Batting second is a very big advantage and luck of captains at toss could decide IPL.&quot;  </P></page>

" Masterful batting from Pandey in the end. KKR were visibly nervous when Krunal Pandya started chipping away at their top order, but he has done fantastically. From 107 for 4 at the end of 14 overs to 178 in the end - 71 runs off the last six overs. This pitch is taking a turn too, so KKR will be mighty confident. Even without Chawla, they have three spinners to put pressure on Mumbai who will feel a little winded at the end of this innings. The chase, soon. </P><P MCID=""9""></P><P MCID=""10"">END</P><P MCID=""11""> </P><P MCID=""12"">OF</P><P MCID=""13""> </P><P MCID=""14"">OVER:</P><P MCID=""15""> </P><P MCID=""16""></P><P MCID=""17"">20 | 23 Runs 1 Wkt | KKR: 178/7</P><P MCID=""18""> </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""19""> MK Pandey81 (47b) </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""20""> MJ McClenaghan4-0-51-1 </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""21""> SL Malinga4-0-36-2 </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""22""> </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""23""> </P><P Lang=""en-US"" MCID=""24""> </P></page>
