Even though replays showed he got a big bottom edge on that. 9.46pm Masterful batting from Pandey in the end. KKR were visibly nervous when Krunal Pandya started chipping away at their top order, but he has done fantastically. From 107 for 4 at the end of 14 overs to 178 in the end - 71 runs off the last six overs. This pitch is taking a turn too, so KKR will be mighty confident.
